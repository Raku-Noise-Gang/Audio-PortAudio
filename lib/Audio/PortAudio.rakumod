=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a mechanism to get audio into and out of your program
via a sound card or some other sub-system supported by the Portaudio
library (http://www.portaudio.com/), this may include "ALSA", "JACK"
or "OSS" on Linux, "CoreAudio" on Mac and "ASIO" on Windows, (of course
the actual support depends on how the library was built on your system.)

You will need to have the portaudio library installed on your system
to use this, it may be available as a package or come pre-installed,
but the details will be specific to your platform.

The interface is somewhat simplified in comparison to the underlying
library and in particular only "blocking" IO is supported at the current
time (though this does not preclude the use of the callback API in the
future, it's just an interface that is natural to a Raku developer
doesn't suggest itself at the moment.)

It is important to note that the constraints of real-time audio data
handling mean that you have to be careful that you allow for consistent
and timely handing of the data to or from the device for proper results,
you may find that for some applications you will need to avoid the use
of any concurrency whatsoever for instance (the streaming example is
such a case where the time budget was such that any unexpected garbage
collection or other processor stealing activity didn't leave the process
enough time spare to recover and the stream eventually became unusable.)

Also it should be noted that some types of source API ("JACK" in
particular,) require that you use a fixed buffer size that is consistent
with that configured for the host service, unfortunately portaudio doesn't
appear to provide a way of discovering this so you may need to either
check with the source configuration or experiment to find a correct and
working value for buffer sizes.  The symptoms of this may include choppy,
"syncopated" or "phased" output.

This is based on the original work of Peschwa
(https://github.com/peschwa/Audio-PortAudio) which I forked and then
just completely hijacked when I realised it could be potentially be made
useful :) So most of the credit probably goes to him.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 method new

    method new()

The constructor doesn't currently take any arguments. It will cause C<initialize()>
for you.

=head2 method version

    method version( --> Str )

This returns the portaudio library version string that may be useful for diagnostic
purposes.

=head2 method initialize

    method initialize( --> Bool )

This starts the portaudio service and will initialise all of the host API drivers
found, which may (depending on the configuration,) cause the drivers to emit some
output (typically ALSA and JACK will do this.) You probably don't need to call this
yourself as it is called by the constructor, though may be necessary after
C<terminate> if you didn't actually end your program. If there was a problem
initializing the library then an exception will be thrown.


=head2 method terminate

    method terminate( --> Int )

This ends the portaudio and will shutdown all the backends, calling any methods
except C<initialise()> after this will give rise to an exception.

=head2 method device-count

    method device-count( --> Int )

This returns the number of devices in the system.

=head2 method device-info

    method device-info(Int $device-number --> DeviceInfo )

This returns the C<Audio::PortAudio::DeviceInfo> object for the device
C<index> which is in the range 0 to C<device-count> exclusive.  If the
device index is out of range or there is some other error an exception
will be thrown.

=head2 method devices

    method devices()

This is a convenience to return a lazy list of the devices as
C<Audio::PortAudio::DeviceInfo> objects, it may be useful to
enumerate the devices but you will need to keep track of the
index in order to be able to open a stream with a particular
device.

=head2 method host-api-index

    method host-api-index(HostApiTypeId $type --> Int )

This returns the index number of the host API as used in the
C<Audio::PortAudio::DeviceInfo> given the host API type, and
can be used to enumerate devices of a certain type from the
C<devices> list. C<HostApiTypeId> is an enumeration with the
following values:

=item InDevelopment

=item DirectSound

=item MME

=item ASIO

=item SoundManager

=item CoreAudio

=item OSS

=item ALSA

=item AL

=item BeOS

=item WDMKS

=item JACK

=item WASAPI

=item AudioScienceHPI

It is unlikely that more than a couple of these will actually
be available on any given system.

=head2 method host-api

    method host-api(HostApiTypeId $type --> HostApiInfo )

Given a C<HostApiTypeId> as described above this will return
a L<Audio::PortAudio::HostApiInfo|#Audio::PortAudio::HostApiInfo> object  that describes the host api on this
system.

=head2 method default-output-device

    method default-output-device( --> DeviceInfo )

This returns a L<Audio::PortAudio::DeviceInfo|#Audio::PortAudio::DeviceInfo> object that
describes the device that will be used for output if the
default output stream is asked for. Depending on the
configuration of your system this may differ from the
C<default-input-device>.  An exception will be thrown
if there was a problem determining the device.

=head2 method default-input-device

    method default-input-device( --> DeviceInfo )

This returns a L<Audio::PortAudio::DeviceInfo|#Audio::PortAudio::DeviceInfo> object that
describes the device that be used for input if the
default input stream is asked for.  Depending on the
configuration of your system this may differ from the
C<default-outpur-device>.  An exception will be thrown
if there was a problem determining the device.

=head2 method open-default-stream

    method open-default-stream(Int $input = 0, Int $output = 2, StreamFormat $format = StreamFormat::Float32, Int $sample-rate = 44100, Int $frames-per-buffer = 256 --> Stream )

This opens a stream for reading and/or writing on the default device,
returning a L<Audio::PortAudio::Stream|#Audio::PortAudio::Stream> object or throwing an
exception if there was a problem opening the stream.

The default values will almost certainly B<not> work for a lot of
applications, of particular importance is C<format> which should
be a member of the enumeration L<Audio::PortAudio::StreamFormat|#Audio::PortAudio::StreamFormat>:

=item Float32

=item Int32

=item Int24

=item Int16

=item Int8

=item UInt8

=item CustomFormat

=item NonInterleaved

Which should firstly match the capabilities of your device and also
C<must> match the bit-size and type of the data that is written, if this
is not adhered to then you are likely to see segfaults or other memory
violation errors.  The C<CustomFormat> is unlikely to be used unless you
have created your own portaudio backend.  The C<NonInterleaved> value
can be ORed (C<+|>) with another value to tell the stream to expect the
data as separate arrays of data for each channel rather than "interleaved"
(samples for each channel in a "frame" appear consecutively in the data,)
this may be more convenient for some applications especially with a high
channel count.

The C<$buffer-size> may also be critical for some backends (such as
"JACK",) that require this to match the value configured in the backend
and that all reads and writes are of the same size, you will need
to consult the configuration of the backend to determine what this
value should be.  Some backends (such as ALSA,) on the other hand,
don't seem to be quite as sensitive and this can be set to some value
that your application can easily handle in the time available ( that is
(buffer-size * channels)/samplerate seconds.) Supplying a value of 0
for buffer size will cause portaudio to adjust its own buffer to suit
the calculated latency and throughput, thus allowing for reads and
writes based on the available data, however this does not over-ride
the earlier comments about fixed buffer sizes for some backends (it
really doesn't work well with JACK for instance.)

The C<$samplerate> should match the capabilities or configuration
of your device and the samplerate of the data that is being
written, if you pass data to C<write> which does not match
this it is unlikely to playback correctly (you may be able to use
L<Audio::Convert::Samplerate|https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Audio-Convert-Samplerate>
to adjust this in your application.)

The C<$input> and C<$output> parameters indicate the number of channels
to be opened for input and output respectively, 0 indicating that the
stream will not be opened for either reading or writing.  The value should
match the number of channels present in the device (or a smaller value,)
some devices may indicate a larger number of channels than are actually
used or connected, if a smaller number of channels is requested than the
device presents then they will be taken in the order that the backend
supports them, there is no way of specifying a specific range of channels,
though you could use the NonInterleaved option to format and ignore the
channels you aren't interested in.  The implication for backends that
are explicitly designed for multi channel applications (such as JACK) is
that you may not be able to distinguish named individual channels within
the device. Sorry about that, but it appears to be a portaudio limitation.


=head2 method open-stream

    method open-stream(StreamParameters $in-params, StreamParameters $out-params, Int $sample-rate = 44100, Int $frames-per-buffer = 256 --> Stream )

This returns the L<Audio::PortAudio::Stream|#Audio::PortAudio::Stream> opened with the parameters supplied
in the L<Audio::PortAudio::StreamParameters|#Audio::PortAudio::StreamParameters> C<$in-params> and C<$out-params>, described
below, if either input or output is not required then a StreamParameters type object
can be passed for either parameter.  C<$sample-rate> and C<$frames-per-buffer> is the
same as for C<open-default-stream> and apply to both input and output.

This will throw an exception if the stream cannot be opened with the parameters supplied,
you can validate the parameters prior to making this call with C<is-format-supported>
described below.

=head2 method is-format-supported

    method is-format-supported(StreamParameters $input, StreamParameters $output, Int $sample-rate --> Bool )

This returns a Boolean to indicate whether the L<Audio::PortAudio::StreamParameters|#Audio::PortAudio::StreamParameters> C<$input> and C<$output>
and the sample rate would work for C<open-stream>, if it returns False it is likely that
C<open-stream> would throw an exception with the same parameters.

=head2 method error-text

    method error-text(Int $error-code --> Str )

This returns the appropriate error text for the integer code returned by the  pulseaudio
API calls, a negative number indicating that it is an error response.  As most of the
methods that call the portaudio API will infact throw an exception with the appropriate
message this may not be all that useful.

=head1 Audio::PortAudio::DeviceInfo

This is the class that describes the portaudio devices as discoverd by C<devices> or
C<device-info>.  It has the following members:


=head2 struct-version

This is the version of this API structure used, it probably isn't all that useful
unless you somehow have mixed versions of backend and portaudio and things aren't
working correctly.

=head2 name;

This is the name of the device that will commonly be displayed in a user interface.

=head2 api-version;

This is the C<host-api-index> (not the host api type,) of the backend API that
supports the device.  See the C<host-api> method to get details of the actual
host API being used.

=head2 max-input-channels;

This is the maximum number of input channels that the device reports, it should be
noted that not all of the number may be usable or connected to a physical device
as some drivers may, for instance, examine the underlying hardware to get this
value and some of the potential inputs may not be physically connected (laptops
with generic audio chips are an example of this,) however it is probably okay
to request up to this number of channels, they just may not work.

=head2 max-output-channels

The maximum output channels that the device reports.  The same caveats apply as
for C<max-input-channels>.

=head2 default-low-input-latency

This is a suggested value for input latency for low latency applications, expressed
as a Num fraction of a second. This can be used in a C<StreamParameters>.  Some
backends such as "JACK" may report this (and the other latency values below,) as
being 0 for "client" applications, in which case it might be necessary to use the
appropriate value for the "default device" of the host API.

=head2 default-low-output-latency

This is a suggested value for output latency for low latency applications, expressed
as a Num fraction of a second. This can be used in a C<StreamParameters>.

=head2 default-high-input-latency;

This is a suggested value for input latency for high latency applications, expressed
as a Num fraction of a second.  This is possibly a better value for Raku applications
which are likely to be "high latency".

=head2 default-high-output-latency

This is a suggested value for output latency for high latency applications, expressed
as a Num fraction of a second.  This is possibly a better value for Raku applications
which are likely to be "high latency".

=head2 default-sample-rate;

This is the default sample rate for the device and will probably be the one that you
want to use when you are opening a stream on the device unless you definitely know
that the device can adjust itself appropriately.  The usual caveats about using the
correct sample rate for input and output data apply. Portaudio expresses this as a
floating point number ( a Num,) but will almost without exception be an Int.  The
C<open-stream> and C<open-default-stream> take C<sample-rate> as an Int which will
be coerced appropriately.

=head2 method host-api

    method host-api( --> HostApiInfo )

This returns the L<Audio::PortAudio::HostApiInfo|#Audio::PortAudio::HostApiInfo> object representing the host api
of this device, which contains useful information about the backed API.

=head1 Audio::PortAudio::HostApiInfo

This class represents the details of a host API or "backend" as returned by several
methods described above.


=head2 struct-version

This is a version number that is internal to the portaudio implementation.

=head2 type

This is the HostApiTypeId and the value will be one of the enumeration described
above.


=head2 name

This is the name of the host API, such as "ALSA", "JACK" etc.

=head2 device-count

This is the number of devices that are recorded for this host API and could
be used to enumerate the devices.

=head2 default-input-device

This is the "device index" of the default input device for this backend, this
can be used to get, for example, the default latency for a backend such as
JACK that might not report the correct value for its clients, by passing this
value to the C<device-info> method of the L<Audio::PortAudio|#Audio::PortAudio> object to get
the appropriate L<Audio::PortAudio::DeviceInfo|#Audio::PortAudio::DeviceInfo> object.

=head2 default-output-device

This is the "device index" of the default output device for this backend, this
can be used to get, for example, the default latency for a backend such as
JACK that might not report the correct value for its clients, by passing this
value to the C<device-info> method of the L<Audio::PortAudio|#Audio::PortAudio> object to get
the appropriate L<Audio::PortAudio::DeviceInfo|#Audio::PortAudio::DeviceInfo> object.

This will usually the same as the input device but this shouldn't be relied on.

=head1 Audio::PortAudio::StreamParameters

Objects of this class are passed as the C<$in-params> and C<$out-params> of
the method C<open-stream> and describe the details required of the input
or outputs to be created. All of the attributes must be filled in unless
otherwise noted. The validity or otherwise of a particular set of parameters
can be checked with C<> before actually using them to open a stream.

=head2 device

This is the "device index" of the required device (that is 0 .. device-count -1)
The device should support the other parameters provided.

=head2 channel-count

This is the integer number of channels that should be opened on the stream for
the input or output, it should be equal to or less than the maximum number of
channels supported by the device.

=head2 sample-format

This is the integer value of an item of the enumeration C<SampleFormat>
described above, it should agree with the type of the data that
you are intending to read from or write to the stream (otherwise
unexpected results may ensue,) not all devices or backend APIs will
support all format types and you may have to consult the documentation
or configuration.  The most commonly supported types are C<Float32>
and C<Int16>.

=head2 suggested-latency

This is the suggested latency for this stream as a Num
fraction of a second.  You probably want to used the device's
<default-high-input-latency> or <default-high-output-latency> though
some backends may entirely ignore this if they have a fixed latency value.

=head2 host-api-specific-streaminfo

This is a Pointer to some data that may be supplied to the backend, it is B<not>
required by portaudio and should generally be left uninitialised.

=head1 Audio::PortAudio::Stream

Objects of this type are returned by C<open-default-stream> and C<open-stream>
and are the primary interface for reading and writing data from/to a device
and for getting the status of the audio stream.

=head2 method start

    method start( --> Bool )

This starts the stream, making it available for reading or writing. Attempting
to read or write without first calling start will give rise to an exception.

An exception will be thrown if the stream cannot be started.

=head2 method close

    method close( --> Bool )

This closes the stream, releasing the device.  If any reads or writes are
attempted after it has been closed then an exception will be thrown.
You should always close a stream after you are done with it as the API
will continue attempting to populate the underlying buffers until closed.

If you attempt to close any already closed stream an exception will be
thrown.

=head2 method stopped

    method stopped( --> Bool )

This returns a Bool to indicate whether the stream is running, it will
return True before C<start> has been called and after C<close>.

=head2 method active

    method active( --> Bool )

This returns a Bool to indicate whether the stream is running, it will
return True after C<start> has been called and before C<close>.

=head2 method write-available

        method write-available( --> Int )

This returns the number of frames that can be written to the stream
without the C<write> call blocking, It may throw an exception if the
stream isn't started or there was some other problem with the stream.

=head2 method write

        method write(CArray $buf, Int $frames --> Int )

This writes the data in the provided CArray, which must contain data
of the correct type as per the C<StreamFormat> (e.g. num32, int16 etc,)
and should contain C<$frames> * C<channels> elements.

The data must be written with a frequency such that the underlying buffer
is kept filled, an exception will be thrown if the data isn't being
fed fast enough and a "buffer under run" occurs before the next write.

For some backends which require a fixed buffer size the number of frames
provided should match the buffer size provided when opening the stream,
not doing so may result in less than ideal results.

If the stream isn't started or there is some other problem writing the
data then an exception will be thrown.

It is deliberate that there is no sugared multi candidates for providing
higher level Raku arrays with the data, as the overhead in copying the
data will typically eat up too much time to keep the buffer filled.
Hopefully this will change in the future.

=head2 method read-available

        method read-available( --> Int )

This returns the number of frames available to be read from a stream, it
may return 0 if the stream isn't opened for input.  It may throw an
exception if there was some problem with the stream.

=head2 method read

        method read(Int $frames, Int $num-channels, Mu:U $type --> CArray )

This reads the specified number of frames of C<$num-channels> from a stream that
is opened for input, the number of channels should agree with that provided when
opening the stream, and the C<$type> should correspond to the type of the data
that will be used for the C<StreamFormat> (i.e. num32, int16, etc,).  The CArray
returned will be typed accordingly and will contain C<$frames> * C<$num-channels>
elements.

If you do not read from the stream fast enough you may experience buffer over-runs,
choppy input, or other artefacts, some backends may consider it fatal and an
exception may be raised or the stream closed.

Usually you should be prepared to read the number of frames that were specified
when the stream was opened, if the backend requires a specific number of frames
for the buffer then this should always be used when reading from the stream.

If there is a problem reading, or the stream has been closed then an exception
will be thrown.

=head2 method info

    method info( --> StreamInfo )

This provides accurate information from the backend while the stream is actually
running, it can be used for informational purposes or possibly to tune some
computation, the L<Audio::PortAudio::StreamInfo|#Audio::PortAudio::StreamInfo> class is described below.

=head1 Audio::PortAudio::StreamInfo

This is the class that is returned by the C<info> method of the Stream.  It contains
information from the backend while the stream is running.

=head2 struct-version

This is the internal version of the structure returned by the API.

=head2 input-latency

This is the calculated latency estimate for input from the backend, it may differ
from that provided as the suggested latency when the stream was opened.  If the
stream was opened for output only this will be 0e0.

=head2 output-latency

This is the calculated latency estimate for output from the backend, it may differ
from that provided as the suggested latency when the stream was opened.  If the
stream was opened for input only this will be 0e0.

=head2 sample-rate

This is the actual sample-rate that is being used by portaudio, this may differ from
that provided to the stream open or reported in the device info if portaudio is aware
of inaccuracies in the information determined from the hardware or configration and
has adjusted it.
